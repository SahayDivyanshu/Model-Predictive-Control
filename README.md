# Speed Control, Obstacle Avoidance & Parking Control for Autonomous Cars

Designed and implemented a Model Predictive Controller to make a self-driving car follow a speed limit, pull into a parking space and avoid obstacles. 
The design steps included the modeling of vehicle motion and building a cost minimizing control strategy.
